  |   Help Zobillie reach the legendary meat farm!                          |

  |   The world has changed. Irrevocably and completely. Green parks have   |
  |   been replaced by grey ruins. Colourful meadows have become toxic      |
  |   swamps. Once vibrant lands are now littered with dust, rubble,        |
  |   concrete, and debris.                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Most creatures did not survive the Great Change. The survivors        |
  |   faired rather poorly in the immediate aftermath, becoming prey to     |
  |   all manner of predator. However, a lucky few managed to survive       |
  |   even then, to adapt, to thrive, to evolve. Zombillie was one such     |
  |   creature.                                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Zombillie lived a comfortable life in his humble cave, hunting for    |
  |   meat, and as he hunted, he grew, and grew, and grew. Everything was   |
  |   going relatively well for Zombillie, except for one problem:          |
  |   Zombillie didn't have enough meat!                                    |
  |                                                                         |
